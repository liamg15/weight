# Weight by day (goal: reach 170 lbs)
Monitoring my weight, recording every time I go to the gym.

Here is the analysis so far from May 16 to October 15, 2023:
-  According to this linear regression model of date and time with weight as the outcome, I gained 0.0096 lbs every day since May 16, 2023.
-  At that rate, I would reach my goal of 170 lbs in 711 days (~ 2 years).
-  Consistent with the circadian rhythm of weight, I'm heavier in the early mornings than later in the day.
